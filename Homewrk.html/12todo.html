            SMTH is short for something.<br> It's one of many words that 
            have been shortened from texting,<br> similar to brb for “be right back” and ty for “thank you.”

            The secret side of me
            I never let you see
            I keep it caged, but I can't control it
            So stay away from me
            The beast is ugly
            I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
            It's scratching on the walls

            Down,
            Here comes the sound,
            Everyone pound your feet to this Phenomenon,
            Now let's make it loud,
            Let me show 'em all how
            You move to this phenomenon,
            Roll! Open your soul,
            Maybe lose control inside of this phenomenon,
            Just let yourself go,
            And let everyone know
            You move to this phenomenon.

            I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
            Losin' my faith today
            We're fallin' off the edge today
            I am just a man, not superhuman
            I'm not superhuman
            Someone save me from the hate
            It's just another war
            Just another family torn
            We're falling from my faith today
            Just a step on the edge
            Just another day in the world we live
            I need a hero to save me now
            I need a hero
            To save me now
            I need a hero to save my life
            A hero will save me
            Just in time
